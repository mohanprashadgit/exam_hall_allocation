## ⚡ Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Locally with XAMPP

1. Clone/copy the repo into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:
   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\exam_hall_allocation\
   ```
2. Start Apache in XAMPP Control Panel.
3. Open in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/exam_hall_allocation/index.html
   ```

### Option 2: Run Locally (No Server)

Just open `index.html` directly in your browser. All features work without a server since data is stored in `localStorage`.

### Option 3: Deploy to Vercel

See the **Deployment** section below.

## 📊 Data Management

All data is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under these keys:

| Key                    | Content                                |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `erp_halls`            | Exam hall definitions and categories   |
| `erp_students`         | Student records (name, dept, reg no)   |
| `erp_seat_allocations` | All seating plan allocations           |

- **Sample data** is auto-seeded on first load (150 students across 5 departments).
- Data persists across browser sessions.
- To reset all data: open browser DevTools → Console → run `localStorage.clear()` → reload page.
